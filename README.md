                                                          USAGE
Run server.py. When It starts to run ip addresses and ports of server1 , server2, room1 and room2 servers are seen on the output.(Server.py gets your ip adress automaticly). 
Now it is time to connect server. Before the run client.py change this code with your local ip adress. self.target_ip = '#put here your local ip adress of your main server (you can learn it from output of your server.py)'. Now run client.py. Client.py asks your nickname. After the nickname is given ,client connects to main voice chat server and  private chat server. If any problem happens to connect server , client tries to connect server every 5 second. After the third try client, shut itselfs down.
